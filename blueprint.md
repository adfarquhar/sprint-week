# Sprint Task Tracker Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a simple Sprint Task Tracker web app. The app is designed for two users, a "Real Estate Agent" and an "App Developer," to manage their shared tasks and track progress.

## Core Features

*   **User Profiles:** "Real Estate Agent" and "App Developer".
*   **Shared Task Board:** Columns for "To Do Today", "In Progress", "Blocked", and "Done".
*   **Drag and Drop:** Move tasks between columns. **(Implemented)**
*   **Task Details:** Title, time estimate (hours), assigned person, priority (high/medium/low). **(Implemented)**
*   **Daily Standup Timer:** 15-minute countdown with prompts. **(Implemented)**
*   **Progress Meter:** Percentage of completed vs. planned tasks. **(Implemented)**
*   **Authentication:** Email/password login with data persistence in Firestore. **(Implemented)**

## Simple Features

*   **Add Task:** Modal form to add new tasks. **(Implemented)**
*   **Mark Complete:** Automatically move tasks to the "Done" column. **(Implemented via drag and drop)**
*   **Daily Reset:** Archive completed tasks. **(Implemented - archives to `daily_archive` collection)**
*   **Sprint Velocity Chart:** Simple chart showing tasks completed per day. **(Implemented - textual summary from `daily_archive`)**
*   **Export:** Export today's accomplishments as a text summary. **(Implemented)**

## Visual Design

*   **Interface:** Clean, minimal, with good contrast. **(Implemented)**
*   **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly design. **(Implemented)**
*   **Color Coding:**
    *   Real Estate Agent: Blue
    *   App Developer: Green
    *   Shared: Purple (currently not used for tasks but for shared UI elements if applicable)
*   **Usability:** Large, clickable elements. **(Implemented)**

## Development Plan

1.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
    *   Create the main layout with containers for the login screen, task board, timer, and progress meter. **(Done)**
    *   Link to `style.css` and `main.js`. **(Done)**
    *   Include Firebase SDKs from the CDN. **(Done - now using modular SDKs)**

2.  **CSS Styling (`style.css`):**
    *   Apply a clean and modern design. **(Done)**
    *   Implement a mobile-responsive layout. **(Done)**
    *   Define the color-coding scheme. **(Done)**

3.  **JavaScript Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   **Authentication:**
        *   Implement Firebase email/password authentication. **(Done - now using modular SDKs)**
    *   **Task Management:**
        *   Implement CRUD operations for tasks. **(Create and Update implemented, Delete for daily reset - now using modular SDKs)**
        *   Enable drag-and-drop functionality. **(Done)**
    *   **Timer and Progress Meter:**
        *   Create the countdown timer and progress meter components. **(Done)**
    *   **Data Handling:**
        *   Interact with Firestore for data storage. **(Done - now using modular SDKs)**
        *   Implement the daily reset and export features. **(Done)**
        *   Implement basic sprint velocity visualization from `daily_archive`. **(Done - textual summary)**

4.  **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Set up a new Firebase project. **(Requires user action and updating `firebaseConfig` in `main.js`)**
    *   Configure Firestore and Firebase Authentication. **(Requires user action and updating `firebaseConfig` in `main.js`)**
    *   Add Firebase configuration to `main.js`. **(Done)**

## Current Status

*   Initial HTML, CSS, and JS structure are in place.
*   Firebase Authentication (login/logout) and Firestore integration for tasks are functional, now using the modular SDK.
*   Tasks can be added, moved between columns (drag & drop), and their status is updated in Firestore.
*   Daily standup timer is implemented.
*   Progress meter shows completion percentage.
*   Daily reset archives completed tasks to a `daily_archive` collection.
*   Export of today's accomplishments is functional (copies to clipboard).
*   Sprint velocity chart now displays a textual summary from `daily_archive`.
*   `.idx/mcp.json` has been updated to include Firebase server configuration.

## Next Steps

The core functionality and modular Firebase SDK migration are complete. The application should now be fully functional. No further steps are immediately required based on the current context.
